Building a REST api
---
My current experience with RESTFUL webservices is two fold. I have used plenty of external services in my brief career. From Meetup, Mandrill to SurveyGizmo, all of them have been enjoyable to learn their quirks, their drawbacks and their successes. Currently, I am working on a project in which I am using a RESTFUL service with and AngularJS front end. The service is using a micro framework called Slim. I have looked into other projects like Silex (Symfony's micro framework) as well as using full Symfony and Zend Framework 2. All offered great ideas, the full frameworks I felt were top hefty for what I am currently working through, while the Silex framework offered great beginnings, but became a very steep learning curve as new controllers we being added. Slim offered flexibilty like Silex, but has been much easier to implement in my applications infancy.

I tend to be a JSON freak. XML offers some fun times and can easily be traversed, but I find JSON to be a format that is easier to digest and more widely used and abused.

Data structures are bit more tricker. For a company such as yours, the biggest data point is the customer. This data point should contain all current profile and maybe credit card / billing info. You can traverse further to look at past records ( returns ) / sales. Another branch from customer would be the current sale if any. Traversing furher would be any product ( size, brand, color ) information that directly pertains to the customer past and present order.
<p>You also would have a data point for the current inventory ( where the product comes from, pricing, colors in stock, sizes in stock ).

Since you are the Uber of tailoring, you also have another set of data to serve. These are your tailors. Each of them would have a profile ( What they specialize in, pricing per article of clothing, products they may offer, areas they serve, maybe even testimonials of some kind ).

These are just a few items I could tick off based upon my limited knowledge of the company overall. I am however; very happy to discuss your application further in person.
